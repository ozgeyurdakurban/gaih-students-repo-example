#Day_4

"""
Course Grade Application:
    - Create 5 students. Ask these students from the user.
    - Each of these students should have a midterm grade, project grade, and final grade.
    - Each student will have a course passing grade.
    - passingGrade=midterm*(0.3)+project*(0.3)+final*(0.4) passing grade should be determined like this.
    - Create a dictionary that keeps these students' information.
    - Calculate the students' grades and transfer them to the list with the help of indexing.
    - Finally, set the students with the highest grade to be in the first index and the student with the lowest grade to be in the last index of the list.
